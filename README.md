# QR Generator - Angular

I needed to generate a QR code for a project I was working on, but I didn't find reliable and free services to do it, and since I was learning Angular, I decided to create one myself.

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

Et voil√†! You have a QR code generator running on your localhost.
